# Dump — Session Log Saver

Saves a summary of the current session to `.codex/packs/unity-game/logs/YYYY-MM-DD-<topic>.md`.

## Steps

1. Ask the user (or infer from conversation): what was the main topic of this session?
2. Create `.codex/packs/unity-game/logs/` if it doesn't exist
3. Write a markdown file named `YYYY-MM-DD-<topic>.md` (use today's date)
4. Populate it with:

```markdown
# Session: <topic>
Date: YYYY-MM-DD

## What We Did
- <bullet summary of work completed>

## Decisions Made
- <architectural or design decisions, with rationale>

## Files Changed
- <list of files written or edited>

## Open Questions / Next Steps
- <anything left unresolved or planned for next session>
```

5. Confirm the file path to the user

## Notes

- Keep entries factual and brief — this is a reference log, not a story
- If nothing significant happened, say so and skip writing the file
- `.codex/packs/unity-game/logs/` should be in `.gitignore` unless the user wants to commit session logs
