# Five — 5 Whys Root Cause Analysis

A focused, disciplined technique for finding the root cause of a problem. Complements `/debug-session` — use `/debug-session` for broad investigation, use `/five` when you already know the symptom and need to trace the cause chain.

## Process

Ask the user to state the problem clearly in one sentence. Then:

**Why 1:** Why did this problem occur?
→ State the immediate cause. Ask the user to confirm or correct.

**Why 2:** Why did [Why 1 answer] happen?
→ Go one level deeper.

**Why 3:** Why did [Why 2 answer] happen?
→ Keep drilling.

**Why 4:** Why did [Why 3 answer] happen?
→ Usually approaching the systemic cause now.

**Why 5:** Why did [Why 4 answer] happen?
→ Root cause. This is what actually needs fixing.

## Rules

- Stop before Why 5 if you reach a true root cause (sometimes it's Why 2 or Why 3)
- If an answer branches into multiple causes, pick the most impactful branch
- Do NOT jump to solutions until the root cause is confirmed
- Each "why" answer must be a factual statement, not a guess — if you're guessing, read the relevant code or logs first

## Output

After reaching root cause, produce:

```
PROBLEM:    <original symptom>
ROOT CAUSE: <final why answer>
FIX:        <single targeted fix that addresses the root cause>
PREVENTION: <what process/rule/test would catch this earlier next time>
```

If the fix requires a code change, proceed only after the user confirms the root cause analysis is correct.
