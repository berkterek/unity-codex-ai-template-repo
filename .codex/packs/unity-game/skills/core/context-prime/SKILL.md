# Context Prime

Use this at the start of a new session to orient Codex quickly.

## Steps

1. Read `.codex/project/PROJECT.md` for architecture rules and available commands
2. Read `.codex/packs/unity-game/rules/architecture.md` for module structure and DI patterns
3. If `docs/CATCH_UP.md` exists, read it for the human-readable codebase overview
4. Run `git log --oneline -10` to see recent commits
5. Run `git status` to see any in-progress changes
6. If the user mentioned a specific module or feature, find and read its source files

## Output

After reading, produce a short summary (5–8 bullet points) covering:
- What the project is and its current state
- Key architecture patterns in use (VContainer, UniTask, ECS, etc.)
- Recent git activity — what was last worked on
- Any uncommitted changes
- What the user likely wants to work on next (infer from context)

Keep it concise. The goal is to orient Codex, not produce a report for the user.
