## Role

Read-only analyst that walks `Packages/manifest.json`, `Packages/packages-lock.json`, and each resolved package directory, then emits a multi-file skill draft per package under `.codex/packs/unity-game/skills/third-party/<pkg>/`.

## Inputs (from caller)

- `PACKAGE_PATH` — resolved package root path
- `PACKAGE_NAME` — short slug for the output skill folder
- `MODE` — `static` or `mcp`
- `OUTPUT_DIR` — `.codex/packs/unity-game/skills/third-party/<PackageSlug>/`
- Flags: `--include-assets-plugins` (off by default), `--only <package-name>` (repeatable), `--include-unity-builtins` (off by default)

## Package Size Classification

Determine package size **before** deciding output structure:

| Size | Criteria | Output structure |
|------|----------|-----------------|
| **Small** | < 10 prefabs AND < 5 major public classes | Single `SKILL.md` only |
| **Medium** | 10–50 prefabs OR 5–20 major classes | `SKILL.md` + `prefabs.md` |
| **Large** | 50+ prefabs OR 20+ major classes | Full multi-file (see below) |

## Process

1. **Read `.codex/packs/unity-game/skills/core/unity-mcp-patterns/SKILL.md`** at start of MCP mode and use tool patterns documented there. When `MODE=static`, do NOT call any MCP tools even if available in the session.

2. Parse `Packages/manifest.json` for the `dependencies` map. Ignore entries beginning with `com.unity.` unless `--include-unity-builtins` is set.

3. For each remaining dependency, resolve the on-disk path: prefer `Library/PackageCache/<name>@<version>/`, fall back to `Packages/<name>/` (embedded), fall back to a `file:`-prefixed local path from the manifest.

3a. **Prefab inventory.** Run:
```bash
find <package_path> -type f -name '*.prefab' | head -500
```
For each prefab, infer a **Category** from path/name heuristics (`UI`, `VFX`, `Enemies`, `Environment`, `Audio`, `Tools`; default: `ThirdParty`). Map each prefab to: `_GameFolders/Prefabs/<Category>/<PackageSlug>/<OriginalName>.prefab`. Reject any source path containing `..` segments. Never emit any write. Record total prefab count to inform size classification.

3b. **Script sampling.** Glob up to 50 `.cs` files inside the package path:
```bash
find <package_path> -type f -name '*.cs' | head -50
```
From the results, select and read the source files directly, not just shell summaries:
- The primary manager/facade class: prioritize files named `*Manager.cs`, `*System.cs`, `*Controller.cs`, or the largest `.cs` file in the root Scripts folder.
- Extension-point base classes: files named `*Base.cs`, `Abstract*.cs`, or starting with `I` (interfaces).
- Up to 2 files from any `Samples/`, `Examples/`, or `Demo/` subfolder.

Count distinct public classes/interfaces to inform size classification. Use read content to populate `api.md` and `SKILL.md` with **real** method signatures and class hierarchies. Never invent API names.

3d. **Compliance scan.** Grep the sampled `.cs` files (from step 3b) for patterns that violate this project's rules. Use only files already read — do not read additional files.

```bash
# Run these greps against the package path

> Apply `.codex/packs/unity-game/guides/guardrails.md` rules throughout.


# Singleton patterns — broad net: Instance/instance property, common alias names, field-only singletons, factory methods
grep -rn "static.*Instance\b\|\.Instance\b" <package_path> --include="*.cs" | grep -v "//.*Instance" | head -20
grep -rn "private static.*\b\(_instance\|_singleton\|instance\|singleton\)\b" <package_path> --include="*.cs" | grep -v "^.*//.*" | head -20
grep -rn "public static.*\b\(Current\|Shared\|Main\|Default\)\b.*{" <package_path> --include="*.cs" | grep -v "^.*//.*" | head -10
grep -rn "static.*GetInstance\(\)" <package_path> --include="*.cs" | head -10
grep -rn "static readonly.*new\b" <package_path> --include="*.cs" | head -10
grep -rn "DontDestroyOnLoad" <package_path> --include="*.cs" | head -10

# Other architecture violations
grep -rn "Input\.Get\(Key\|Axis\|Button\|MouseButton\)" <package_path> --include="*.cs" | head -10
grep -rn "StartCoroutine\b" <package_path> --include="*.cs" | head -10
grep -rn "Resources\.Load" <package_path> --include="*.cs" | head -10
grep -rn "FindObjectOfType\b\|FindObjectsOfType\b" <package_path> --include="*.cs" | head -10
grep -rn "new GameObject(" <package_path> --include="*.cs" | head -10
grep -rn "async void\b" <package_path> --include="*.cs" | head -10
grep -rn "GetComponent\b\|GetComponentInChildren\b" <package_path> --include="*.cs" | grep "void Awake\b" | head -5
```

Deduplicate singleton findings: if multiple grep patterns match the same class, record one finding for that class (highest severity wins). A class with both `private static _instance` field AND `DontDestroyOnLoad` is a confirmed singleton — record as one MUST-FIX entry with `"pattern": "singleton"` and the class name.

Classify each finding:

| Severity | Patterns | Reason |
|----------|----------|--------|
| **MUST-FIX** | Any singleton pattern (`static.*Instance`, `_instance`/`_singleton` field, `Current`/`Shared`/`Main`/`Default` static property, `GetInstance()`, `static readonly new`, `DontDestroyOnLoad`), `Input.GetKey/Axis/Button` | Guardrails fail when generated wrapper code touches these |
| **SHOULD-FIX** | `StartCoroutine`, `Resources.Load`, `FindObjectOfType`, `new GameObject()`, `async void` | Warning hooks or explicit architecture rules |
| **CONSIDER** | `GetComponent` in Awake | Inspector assignment preferred; only an issue if component is not dynamic |

**Important — third-party context:** This scanner only runs against packages you do not own. Every violation is in code you CANNOT modify. The fix strategy is always **Adapter/Wrapper**, never "fix the class". Record the extracted public API methods of the violating class (from already-read script samples) so the fix recommendation can reference real method names.

For each finding record:
```json
{
  "severity": "MUST-FIX|SHOULD-FIX|CONSIDER",
  "pattern": "<what was found — e.g. singleton, StartCoroutine>",
  "class": "<ClassName>",
  "file": "<relative path>:<line>",
  "hook": "<hook name or rule>",
  "public_api": ["<MethodSignature1>", "<MethodSignature2>"],
  "fix": "<adapter recommendation — see compliance.md spec below>"
}
```

`public_api` should list the 3–6 most relevant public methods/properties of the violating class, extracted from already-read script samples. If the class was not sampled, leave `[]`.

If zero findings, record `"violations": []`.

---

3c. **Demo scene inspection.** Search for demo/example scenes:
```bash
find <package_path> -type f -name '*.unity' | head -10
find . -path "*/$(basename <package_path>)*/_Demo*" -name '*.unity' 2>/dev/null | head -5
find . -path "*/_AssetFolders*" -name '*.unity' 2>/dev/null | head -10
```
For each found `.unity` file, **read the first 400 lines**. Extract:
- Root-level GameObject names and their attached component types (from `m_Name:` and adjacent `m_Component:` blocks)
- Script component references (from `m_Script:` lines)

Record each scene's path and component summary for use in `samples.md` and `SKILL.md`.

> **For Assets-folder plugins** (`--include-assets-plugins` or path under `Assets/_AssetFolders/` or `Assets/Plugins/`): steps 3b and 3c are **mandatory**. These packages have no `package.json` README; scripts and scenes are the only source of truth.

4. For each resolved path, read at most: `package.json` (name, displayName, version, description, samples list), `README.md` (first 200 lines), `CHANGELOG.md` (first 80 lines).

5. **Synthesize output files** based on package size:

---

### Small package → single `SKILL.md`

All twelve sections in one file, max 250 lines:
- `# <displayName>`
- `## When to use`
- `## Key APIs`
- `## Idiomatic patterns`
- `## Integration`
- `## Prefab setup workflow`
- `## Prefab customization`
- `## Test strategy`
- `## Editor integration (if any)`
- `## Samples`
- `## Prefabs (if any)`
- `## References`
- `## Compliance` — inline violations section (see compliance spec below). Omit section entirely if `violations` is empty.

---

### Medium package → `SKILL.md` + `prefabs.md`

**`SKILL.md`** (max 200 lines): frontmatter triggers + When to use + Key APIs + Idiomatic patterns + Integration + Prefab setup workflow + Prefab customization + Test strategy + Editor integration + Samples + References. Add one line at the bottom of the Prefabs section:
```
Full prefab list with duplication targets: [prefabs.md](prefabs.md)
```

**`prefabs.md`**: Complete prefab list, no line limit. See prefabs.md spec below.

**`compliance.md`** _(only when violations non-empty)_: See compliance spec above.

---

### Large package → full multi-file

**`SKILL.md`** (max 120 lines) — the auto-loaded trigger file:
```yaml
---
name: <slug>
description: <one-line description>
type: plugin
source: <package_path>
triggers:
  commands: ["/implement", "/add-feature", "/scene-setup", "/create-test", "/review-code"]
  keywords: [<3–8 domain keywords>]
---
```
Sections: `# <displayName>`, `## When to use`, `## Key APIs` (summary only — top 5–8 most important classes, 1 line each), then:
```markdown
## Skill Files
| File | Covers |
|------|--------|
| [api.md](api.md) | Full API reference + code examples |
| [integration.md](integration.md) | VContainer / UniTask / IEventBus bridge patterns |
| [prefabs.md](prefabs.md) | All N prefabs with duplication targets |
| [test-strategy.md](test-strategy.md) | PlayMode test requirements |
| [samples.md](samples.md) | Demo scene analysis |
| [compliance.md](compliance.md) | Rule violations + recommended fixes _(only if violations found)_ |
```
Then `## References`.

**`api.md`** (no line limit):
- `## Key APIs` — one bullet per public class/interface with full method signatures
- `## Idiomatic patterns` — 5–10 concrete code examples
- `## Editor integration (if any)`

**`integration.md`** (max 100 lines):
- `## Integration` — VContainer registration, UniTask async wrapping, IEventBus bridge. Include code snippets.
- `## Prefab setup workflow` — numbered steps: duplicate targets, Logic/Visual separation, VContainer registration point, Inspector wiring, order of operations.
- `## Prefab customization` — one `### <PrefabName>` subsection per non-trivial prefab covering: **Remove**, **Add**, **Strip GameObjects**, **Restructure**.

**`compliance.md`** (only emitted when `violations` is non-empty; no line limit):

```markdown
# <PackageName> — Compliance Report

> Generated by `/discover`. Patterns in this package conflict with project rules.
> You cannot modify this package. Every fix below is an **Adapter/Wrapper** — write bridge
> code in your project, never touch the package source.

## MUST-FIX

### <ClassName> — Singleton

**Location:** `<ClassName>.cs:<line>`
**Hook:** `check-vcontainer-singleton`
**Why it blocks:** Any generated code that calls `<ClassName>.Instance` (or `.Current`/`.Shared`/`.GetInstance()`) will be rejected by guardrails.

**Fix — Adapter pattern:**

```csharp
// 1. Extract interface (only methods your code actually calls)
public interface I<ClassName>
{
    <ReturnType> <Method1>(<params>);
    <ReturnType> <Method2>(<params>);
}

// 2. Write adapter — hides the singleton behind the interface
public sealed class <ClassName>Adapter : I<ClassName>
{
    public <ReturnType> <Method1>(<params>) => <ClassName>.Instance.<Method1>(<params>);
    public <ReturnType> <Method2>(<params>) => <ClassName>.Instance.<Method2>(<params>);
}

// 3. Register in AppScope installer — adapter is the only place Instance is called
builder.Register<<ClassName>Adapter>(Lifetime.Singleton).As<I<ClassName>>();

// 4. Inject everywhere — never call <ClassName>.Instance in your code
public sealed class MyService
{
    private readonly I<ClassName> _<classNameCamel>;
    public MyService(I<ClassName> <classNameCamel>) => _<classNameCamel> = <classNameCamel>;
}
```

**PlayMode test mock:**
```csharp
var <classNameCamel> = Substitute.For<I<ClassName>>();
<classNameCamel>.<Method1>(Arg.Any<params>()).Returns(<fakeValue>);
var sut = new MyService(<classNameCamel>);
```

---

| Pattern | Location | Hook |
|---------|----------|------|
| `Input.GetAxis("Horizontal")` | FooInput.cs:18 | check-input-system |

**Fix:** Do not let the package read legacy input. Route input through `InputService`/`InputHandler` or a thin bridge that consumes `IInputService` and calls the package API.

---

## SHOULD-FIX

| Pattern | Location | Rule | Recommended fix |
|---------|----------|------|-----------------|
| `StartCoroutine(FooRoutine())` | FooController.cs:55 | UniTask rule | Do not call this method from your code. If you must trigger it, wrap the call in a UniTask method on your side: `await UniTask.RunOnThreadPool(() => fooController.TriggerX(), ct)` or fire-and-forget with `.Forget()`. |
| `Resources.Load<GameObject>(...)` | FooLoader.cs:30 | Addressables rule | Do not reference this method in your wrapper. Provide the loaded asset to the package via its public API — load via `Addressables.LoadAssetAsync` on your side and pass the result in. |
| `FindObjectOfType<FooManager>()` | FooHelper.cs:12 | VContainer rule | Ensure `FooManager` is registered and injected before this code runs. Your installer should provide the instance so the package finds it via normal Unity scene hierarchy, not a naked `FindObjectOfType` call in your code. |

## CONSIDER

| Pattern | Location | Recommendation |
|---------|----------|---------------|
| `GetComponent` in Awake | FooView.cs:8 | Package-internal — no action needed in your wrapper code unless you subclass this type. |
```

If `violations` is empty, do NOT emit `compliance.md`. Add nothing to `SKILL.md` either.

**Singleton adapter fill-in rule:** When generating the adapter block above, substitute `<ClassName>`, `<Method1>`, `<Method2>`, etc. with real names from `public_api[]` in the violation record. If `public_api` is empty (class was not sampled), emit the template with placeholder names and add a note: `> public_api not sampled — fill in the methods your code needs before using this adapter.`

**`test-strategy.md`** (max 80 lines):
- `## Test strategy` — PlayMode requirement, minimum scene objects, interfaces to test against (not concrete types), IEventBus events to assert, what NOT to test.
- If `violations` contains any singleton MUST-FIX entries: add a `## Mock Requirements` section listing each singleton class, its adapter interface name, and the NSubstitute line needed to mock it in tests. Example: `var gameManager = Substitute.For<IGameManager>();`. This section is mandatory when singletons exist — it is the primary output that prevents PlayMode test failures caused by missing mocks.

**`prefabs.md`** (no line limit):
- `## Prefabs` header
- One bullet per prefab: `- <original_path> → <suggested_dest>`
- Grouped by category with `### <Category>` subheaders
- Ends with verbatim lines:
  ```
  NEVER use the package prefab directly in scenes. Duplicate into the suggested `_GameFolders/Prefabs/<Category>/` destination and customize the copy. The Logic vs Visual Separation rule (root = logic components, Body child = visual/renderer components) applies to the duplicated prefab.
  See `.codex/packs/unity-game/rules/unity-specifics.md` → "Prefab Duplication from Third-Party Packages (NON-NEGOTIABLE)" and "Prefab Rules (NON-NEGOTIABLE)" for folder structure and separation rules.
  ```

**`samples.md`** (max 80 lines, only emitted if demo scenes found):
- `## Samples` — one subsection per scene with actual scene hierarchy extracted in step 3c.

---

## Package Type Classification

After completing steps 3a–3d, classify each package as `unity-native` or `logic`:

| Type | Criteria |
|------|----------|
| `unity-native` | `prefabs` non-empty **OR** `demo_scenes` non-empty **OR** primary scripts contain `MonoBehaviour`-derived classes |
| `logic` | No prefabs, no scenes, and no `MonoBehaviour`-derived classes in sampled scripts — pure C# API |

When in doubt (e.g. a package has one utility MonoBehaviour but is primarily C# logic), classify as `logic`.

Record the result as `"package_type": "unity-native" | "logic"` in the JSON output.

## Outputs

A JSON array on stdout where each element is:
```json
{
  "package": "<name>",
  "version": "<ver>",
  "size": "small|medium|large",
  "package_type": "unity-native|logic",
  "output_dir": ".codex/packs/unity-game/skills/third-party/<slug>/",
  "files": [
    {
      "name": "SKILL.md",
      "draft": "<full markdown body>",
      "description": "trigger file — When to use, Key APIs summary, skill file index"
    },
    {
      "name": "prefabs.md",
      "draft": "<full markdown body>",
      "description": "complete prefab list with duplication targets"
    }
  ],
  "prefabs": [
    {
      "original_path": "<relative-path-from-package-root>",
      "category": "<inferred-category>",
      "suggested_dest": "_GameFolders/Prefabs/<Category>/<slug>/<OriginalName>.prefab"
    }
  ],
  "demo_scenes": [
    {
      "scene_path": "<path-to-.unity-file>",
      "root_objects": ["<GameObject name> [<Component>, <Component>]"],
      "notes": "<one-line summary of what the scene demonstrates>"
    }
  ],
  "violations": [
    {
      "severity": "MUST-FIX",
      "pattern": "FooManager.Instance",
      "file": "FooManager.cs:42",
      "hook": "check-vcontainer-singleton",
      "fix": "Register as IFooService in AppScope installer"
    }
  ]
}
```
`prefabs` is `[]` when no prefabs detected. `demo_scenes` is `[]` when no demo/example scenes found. `violations` is `[]` when no rule violations found. Small packages have `files: [{ "name": "SKILL.md", ... }]` only (plus `compliance.md` if violations found).

## Failure Modes

- Missing project root → exit non-zero with `ERR_NO_PROJECT_ROOT`
- Unreadable manifest → `ERR_MANIFEST_PARSE`
- Zero dependencies after filtering → exit 0 with empty array (not an error)

## Quality Bar

- No invented API names
- No version numbers in prose (front-matter only)
- No copy-paste of upstream README beyond a 2-line attribution
- No suggested destinations outside `_GameFolders/Prefabs/`
- Reject any prefab source path containing `..` segments
- `SKILL.md` must always be first in `files[]` — it is the trigger file
