# Knowledge Graph

The template ships with a Graphify-inspired knowledge graph at `.codex/graph/graph.json` (schema v1.3.0).
Opt-in via `.codex/project/FEATURES.json` (`"graph": true`). When enabled, it is the single source of truth
for `/catch-up`, `/orchestrate` pre-scan, and `/context-prime`.

**Pipeline:** detect → extract (C# / asmdef / MCP) → build → finalize-calls → analyze → report → export

**Commands:**
- `/build-knowledge-graph [--full|--incremental] [--skip-mcp] [--validate] [--validate-with-codex]`
- `/knowledge-graph <summary|implementers|publishers|subscribers|registrations|scope-tree|prefab|violations|diff|callers|impact|path|god-nodes>`

**Update modes:**
- Manual → `/build-knowledge-graph`
- Continuous local watch → `bash .codex/graph/graph-watch.sh`
- Validation → `/build-knowledge-graph --validate`

Codex has no automatic hook mechanism, so the graph is not rebuilt after every
write unless you explicitly run the watch script.

## Extractor Reliability Notes

Lessons from live testing — read before debugging graph output.

### csharp-extractor.sh

- **Multi-line class declarations** (`class Foo\n  : IBar`) are handled by a python3 parser that joins up to 6 lines. Single-line and multi-line declarations both produce correct `base_types[]` and `implements[]`.
- **Fully qualified interface names** (`Game.Abstracts.IFoo`) are reduced to their last segment (`IFoo`) before being stored. Both short and qualified names produce correct `implements[]`.
- **methods[] extraction** — every public/private/protected method is captured per class (name, signature, line, is_async, is_static, return_type). Confidence: `INFERRED` (regex mode).
- **partial_calls[] extraction** — call sites are extracted per file and merged into `codebase.calls[]` by `graph-builder.py`. BCL types (`Debug`, `Mathf`, `Vector3`…) and C# keywords are filtered out. Confidence: `INFERRED`.
- **Stale MCP cache** — when `mcp-extract.json` is older than 60 minutes, `graph-builder.py` retains prefabs and scenes from the existing `graph.json` instead of dropping them. Run `/build-knowledge-graph` with Unity Editor open to refresh MCP data. `--full` always invalidates the MCP cache regardless of age — retained prefabs are cross-checked against disk and stale paths emit `STALE_PREFAB_PATH` warnings in `validation.warnings[]`.
- **Missing scripts** — null component entries (`"null"` in `comps=(...)`) during MCP extraction set `has_missing_scripts: true` on the GO/prefab. `graph-builder.py` collects these into `MISSING_SCRIPT` warnings in `validation.warnings[]`. Surface with `/knowledge-graph violations`.
- **Python JSON passing** — both `STALE_PATH_WARNINGS` and `MISSING_SCRIPT_WARNINGS` blocks pass data via env vars (`MCP_PREFABS_JSON`, `MISSING_INPUT_JSON`) + `json.loads(os.environ[...])`, not `echo | python3 -`. Bash heredoc overrides stdin so the pipe pattern silently delivers empty input to Python.
- **Subfolder layout (UNITY_FOLDER)** — `STALE_PATH_WARNINGS` passes `UNITY_FOLDER` to Python and prepends it to the `Assets/...` path before `os.path.exists()`. Without this, every prefab appears stale on projects where `Assets/` is not at repo root.
- **gameObjects key casing** — MISSING_SCRIPT detection reads `scene.get("gameObjects", scene.get("gameobjects", []))` to handle both camelCase (MCP cache output) and lowercase (older extractions).

### graph-builder.py call edge merge

- **Full build (`--full`):** discards retained call edges, uses only freshly extracted `partial_calls[]`.
- **Incremental with changed files:** retains edges from unchanged files, replaces edges for changed files only.
- **Incremental with no changed files:** retains all existing call edges unchanged (no re-extraction needed).
- After assembly, `graph-traversal.py --finalize-calls` deduplicates edges and promotes `EXTRACTED` over `INFERRED` for the same caller+callee+file+line.

### graph-traversal.py

New in v1.1.0. Pure Python 3 stdlib — no pip install needed.

| Subcommand | What it does |
|---|---|
| `impact <Node> [--hops N]` | BFS forward (downstream) + reverse (upstream) from node, default 3 hops |
| `callers <Class.Method>` | One-hop reverse lookup — direct callers only |
| `path <A> <B>` | BFS shortest path on forward call graph; exits 1 if no path |
| `god-nodes [--top N]` | Rank nodes by in+out degree; `is_god_node: true` when total > 20 |
| `--finalize-calls` | Sort + dedupe + promote confidence in `calls[]`; atomically rewrites `graph.json` |

### MCP Extraction (mcp-extractor.md)

These MCP tool behaviors were discovered during live Editor testing — they differ from what the tool documentation implies:

| Tool / Pattern | Actual behavior |
|----------------|----------------|
| `manage_scene get_hierarchy` with `target` param | **target is ignored** — always returns full root list. Use `execute_code` recursive delegate for deep traversal. |
| `manage_components` | **No `get` action.** Only `add`, `remove`, `set_property` exist. Use `execute_code` + `SerializedObject` for reading. |
| `manage_prefabs get_hierarchy` | Works correctly for root component list. Does **not** return child GO hierarchy — use `execute_code` + `AssetDatabase` recursive walk for children. |
| `execute_code` compiler | **Roslyn not available** in most Unity projects. Always use `compiler: "codedom"` (C# 6 — no local functions, no string interpolation with complex expressions). |
| `VContainer.Unity.ParentReference` | Is a **struct** — `!= null` won't compile in CodeDom. Use `.TypeName` (string) field; empty string = no parent. |

Full working code snippets for all patterns: see `.codex/graph/extractors/mcp-extractor.md`.


## v1.2.0 Fields (new in Graph Module v2)

| Field | jq path | Description |
|-------|---------|-------------|
| Communities | `.codebase.communities` | Class community groups from `graph_cluster.py` |
| Surprising connections | `.analysis.surprising_connections` | Cross-scope/assembly/community call edges |
| Enhanced god-nodes | `.analysis.enhanced_god_nodes` | God-nodes enriched with `community_id` and `severity` |
| Accuracy report | `.validation.accuracy` | Extraction accuracy spot-check vs source files |

### graph_cluster.py

New in v1.2.0. Detects class communities from call edges using greedy modularity (stdlib) or Louvain (via optional `networkx`). Writes `codebase.communities[]`.

- `algorithm: "greedy-modularity-stdlib"` — default, no pip install needed. Works on all graphs but produces coarser clusters on sparse codebases.
- `algorithm: "louvain-networkx"` — higher quality, recommended for projects with > 30 classes; requires `pip install networkx`

> **Recommendation:** Run `pip install networkx` once after setup. On sparse graphs (few call edges, early-stage projects) the stdlib algorithm may group everything into one large community or produce no merges at all. Louvain handles this correctly.

### graph_analyze.py

New in v1.2.0. Classifies surprising cross-boundary edges and enriches god-nodes with community data.

- `CROSS_SCOPE` → severity `warning` (two classes in different VContainer scopes calling each other directly)
- `CROSS_ASSEMBLY` → severity `info`
- `CROSS_COMMUNITY` → severity `info`

### graph_validate.py

Two-mode validator — always runs during graph-builder.

**Mode 1 — Consistency (default, fast):** Checks `graph.json` internal integrity. No source files read.
- Orphan events: published/subscribed but not declared in graph
- Dangling call edges: callee class not in graph
- Installer registrations referencing missing classes
- Results → `validation.consistency.{issues[], issue_count, passed}`

**Mode 2 — Accuracy (`--accuracy` flag, slow):** Re-extracts a sample of source files via `csharp_extractor.py` (tree-sitter) and compares against graph facts. Single parse source — no duplicate regex logic.
- `--sample N` (default 20), `--seed N` (default 42)
- Results → `validation.accuracy.{agreement_pct, matches, mismatches, checks[]}`
- If `< 90%`, `low_accuracy_warning: true` recommends `--full` rebuild
- Skipped automatically if tree-sitter is unavailable (exit 2)
- Run manually: `python3 .codex/graph/graph_validate.py --graph .codex/graph/graph.json --accuracy`

**Never touches `validation.warnings[]`** — that array is owned by `graph-validator.sh`

### Query cheatsheet additions (v1.2.0)

- "Which classes form a module?" → `/knowledge-graph communities`
- "Architecture drifting where?" → `/knowledge-graph surprising`
- "God-nodes with community context?" → `/knowledge-graph god-nodes` (now uses `analysis.enhanced_god_nodes[]` when present)

---

## Hybrid Architecture

The knowledge graph uses a two-backend split when `hybrid_graph` is enabled in `.codex/project/FEATURES.json` (default `false`):

| Query group | Backend | Queries |
|---|---|---|
| Call-graph (4) | `graph-mcp-server.py` via `graph_bfs_core.py` | `callers`, `impact`, `path`, `god-nodes` |
| Unity-semantic (11) | `jq` / `graph.json` (unchanged) | `summary`, `implementers`, `publishers`, `subscribers`, `registrations`, `scope-tree`, `prefab`, `violations`, `diff`, `communities`, `surprising` |

**`hybrid_graph` flag** in `.codex/project/FEATURES.json` gates all routing. Default is `false`.

- **Off (default):** behaviour identical to today — all 15 subcommands resolved via `jq`/`graph-traversal.py`, zero stderr output, no pip probe.
- **On + MCP connected (State A):** call-graph queries dispatched via `mcp__graph_mcp__*` tools backed by `graph_bfs_core.py`. Unity-semantic queries unchanged.
- **On + MCP absent (State B):** Bash-emitted warning on stderr + automatic fallback to `graph-traversal.py` (same result, slower startup due to lazy `pip` probe).

**Routing skill:** `.codex/skills/core/knowledge-graph-hybrid.md` — read before dispatching any call-graph query when `hybrid_graph` is enabled.

---

## Hybrid MCP Registration (User-applied)

The graph MCP server (`graph-mcp-server.py`) exposes the knowledge graph as MCP tools (`mcp__graph_mcp__*`) so Codex can query it directly during a session. Register it in the Codex MCP configuration used by your local CLI session.

### Prerequisites

Run this once in the same environment whose `python3` Codex CLI invokes:

```bash
pip install mcp
```

### MCP server entry

Add a `graph-mcp` server entry that runs the repo-local server:

```json
"mcpServers": {
  "graph-mcp": {
    "command": "python3",
    "args": [".codex/graph/graph-mcp-server.py"]
  }
}
```

**Merge example** — if your MCP config already has another server:

```json
"mcpServers": {
  "existing-server": { "command": "..." },
  "graph-mcp": {
    "command": "python3",
    "args": [".codex/graph/graph-mcp-server.py"]
  }
}
```

### Notes

- No `--watch` argument is needed — the server checks file mtime on each handler call and reloads automatically.
- The server reads `graph.json`, `scenes.json`, and `prefabs.json` from `.codex/graph/`.

### Verification

After editing the MCP config, restart Codex CLI. In the new session, `mcp__graph_mcp__*` tools should appear in the tool list. If they do not appear, confirm `pip install mcp` succeeded for the correct `python3` binary and that the config syntax is valid.
