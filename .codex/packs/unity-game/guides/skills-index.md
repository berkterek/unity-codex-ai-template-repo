# Skills Library (`.codex/packs/unity-game/skills/`)

Pre-built reference skills loaded by commands on demand. Organized by category:

## Core (`skills/core/`)

Infrastructure skills that govern how Codex agents reason and act across tasks:

| Skill | Covers |
|-------|--------|
| `model-routing` | Automatic model selection heuristics — file count, complexity, risk factors |
| `deep-interview` | 5-dimension ambiguity gating before implementation starts |
| `grill-me` | One-question-at-a-time design stress-test — challenges an existing plan, resolves branches, produces a Decision Record |
| `learner` | Post-debug insight extraction — writes findings to project learning notes |
| `unity-instincts` | Instinct system for learned Unity patterns — capture, score, promote, apply |
| `unity-asmdef` | .asmdef authoring — references, platforms, define constraints, user-invocable |
| `source-driven-development` | Fetch official Unity docs before writing API calls — cites sources, flags deprecated APIs, surfaces version conflicts |
| `documentation-and-adrs` | ADR creation for architectural decisions — `/adr` command, `docs/decisions/` folder, lifecycle management |
| `planning-and-task-breakdown` | Vertical slice decomposition + per-task acceptance criteria for `/create-plan` and `/plan-workflow` |
| `code-simplification` | Chesterton's Fence discipline for `/clean-slop` — understand before removing, behavior-preserving refactor |
| `commit-trailers` | Conventional commit trailers — co-author, ticket links, sign-off |
| `event-systems` | Decide which event mechanism to use — C# events vs IEventBus vs Action vs UnityEvent |
| `event-bus` | Project IEventBus implementation — location, namespace, Subscribe/Unsubscribe/Publish API, EventBusAccessor |

Used by /implement, /orchestrate, /fix, /fix-deep, /generate-tests, /create-test, and /create-plan before any test writing begins. When result is NoTest (LifetimeScope, ScriptableObject, Baker, IComponentData, config-only changes), tester agent is skipped entirely |
| `unity-ugui` | Runtime UGUI implementation — View scripts, Canvas/MCP setup, HUD, Popup/Dialog, Scroll View pool, safe area |
| `fix-codex` | Full Codex-driven fix pipeline — Codex analyzes fresh (no prior hypotheses), implements, then reviewer checks correct location, root cause, completeness, and architecture; committer on APPROVED |
| `caveman` | Ultra-compressed communication mode (~75% fewer tokens) — `/caveman` to enter, `/normal` to exit |
| `context-prime` | Brief Codex on project context at session start — reads key files and summarizes current state |

## Discovered Packages (`skills/third-party/`)

Generated by `/discover`. Each package folder contains `SKILL.md` (auto-loaded trigger) plus optional split files for large packages:

| File | Covers |
|------|--------|
| `SKILL.md` | Trigger file — When to use, Key APIs summary, links to other files |
| `api.md` | Full API reference + idiomatic code examples |
| `prefabs.md` | Complete prefab list with duplication targets (no line limit) |
| `integration.md` | VContainer / UniTask / IEventBus bridge patterns + Prefab setup workflow + customization |
| `test-strategy.md` | PlayMode test requirements, minimum scene setup, mock strategy |
| `samples.md` | Demo scene analysis — real GameObject/component hierarchy |
| `compliance.md` | Rule violations found in package + recommended fixes — **only emitted when violations exist** |

Small packages (< 10 prefabs) use a single `SKILL.md` (with inline `## Compliance` section if violations found). Medium packages add `prefabs.md`. Large packages (50+) use the full split. Pre-built static skills that came with the template remain in `skills/plugins/`.

**Compliance severities:**
- `MUST-FIX` — blocking hooks will fire (e.g. singleton pattern → `check-vcontainer-singleton`, legacy Input → `check-input-system`)
- `SHOULD-FIX` — warning hooks or explicit architecture rules (e.g. `StartCoroutine` → UniTask, `Resources.Load` → Addressables)
- `CONSIDER` — good practice improvements (e.g. `GetComponent` in Awake → `[SerializeField]`)

## Learned Skills (`skills/learned/`)

Generated by `/learn` from project-specific patterns. Empty until `/learn` is run.

| Skill | Covers |
|-------|--------|

> Skills are read-only reference files. They inform Codex decisions but do not execute code. The `/learn` command writes new skills to `skills/learned/` based on patterns extracted from your specific project.

## Writing New Skills

Skills support a `model-tier` frontmatter field to control which tier runs them:

```markdown
---
name: my-skill
model-tier: heavy   # light | normal | heavy
---
```

Omit `model-tier` to inherit from the calling command. Use `light` for lookup/reference skills, `heavy` for skills that guide architectural decisions.
