# Prefab Rules (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

Every GameObject placed in a scene must be an instance of a prefab. Bare (non-prefab) GameObjects are forbidden — except scene separators/organizers (empty GameObjects used purely as hierarchy dividers with no components).

**Why:** Bare GameObjects cannot be reused, are hard to maintain across scenes, and break Addressables-based spawning.

## new GameObject() is Forbidden (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

`new GameObject()` is forbidden in all runtime code — no exceptions. This includes Pool, Factory, and Spawner classes. Every GameObject must originate from a prefab.

```csharp
// BAD — forbidden everywhere in runtime code
var go = new GameObject("Enemy");
var go = new GameObject("Bullet", typeof(Rigidbody));

// GOOD — instantiate from prefab
var instance = Instantiate(_prefab, position, rotation);
var instance = Instantiate(_prefab, parent, false);

// GOOD — Addressables
var instance = await Addressables.InstantiateAsync(address).ToUniTask(ct);
```

**Why:** `new GameObject()` produces a bare object with no prefab backing — it cannot be tracked by Addressables, has no variant chain, and breaks the single-source-of-truth prefab model. Even pools and factories must instantiate from a prefab; they just manage the lifecycle of those instances.

The `check-no-runtime-instantiate` hook blocks this with exit 2 on every Write/Edit.

## Destroy() Rules

`Destroy()` usage depends on context:

**Outside Pool/Manager/Spawner classes — warn:**
If an object is pool-managed, call `pool.Return()` or `SetActive(false)` instead of `Destroy()`. The hook warns when `Destroy()` is found outside Pool/Manager/Spawner files.

**Inside Pool/Manager/Spawner classes — two allowed cases:**

```csharp
// Case 1 — Pool capacity trim: pool exceeds max capacity, destroy the excess
public void ReturnToPool(GameObject obj)
{
    if (_pool.Count >= MAX_CAPACITY)
        Destroy(obj);       // over capacity — destroy the excess
    else
        _pool.Enqueue(obj); // under limit — keep it
}

// Case 2 — Manager shutdown: the pool/manager is no longer needed (e.g. level change)
public void Shutdown()
{
    Destroy(gameObject); // destroys manager + all pooled children
}
```

**Rules:**
- Pool capacity limit is defined as a constant in the pool class (`private const int MAX_CAPACITY = 50`)
- Never destroy pooled objects below the capacity limit — return them to the pool instead
- Manager shutdown (`Destroy(gameObject)`) is only valid when the entire pool is being decommissioned — never use it to release individual objects

## Prefab Variants for Shared Behavior

When multiple objects share a common base, create a base prefab and derive variants from it. Never duplicate prefabs manually.

```
BaseEnemy.prefab          ← base: shared components, default values
├── FastEnemy.prefab      ← variant: overrides Speed, visual
└── TankEnemy.prefab      ← variant: overrides Health, Size, visual
```

- Variants inherit all components and values from the base
- Only override what actually differs — keep overrides minimal
- Never copy-paste a prefab and tweak it — use Prefab Variants

### When to Use Base + Variant vs Separate Prefab

| Situation | Decision |
|-----------|----------|
| 2+ prefabs share the same component set | Base + Variant |
| Only 1–2 fields differ (Sort Order, Layer, speed) | Base + Variant |
| Completely different component structure | Separate prefab |
| Name is similar but content is fundamentally different | Separate prefab |

### Canvas Prefabs — BaseCanvas Pattern (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

Every project that has multiple Canvas prefabs **must** use a `BaseCanvas` prefab with Prefab Variants. Never create independent Canvas prefabs that duplicate the same `Canvas` + `CanvasScaler` + `GraphicRaycaster` setup.

```
_GameFolders/Prefabs/UI/Canvases/
├── BaseCanvas.prefab           ← Canvas + CanvasScaler (reference resolution) + GraphicRaycaster
├── CanvasHUD.prefab            ← variant: Sort Order 0, HUD children
├── CanvasJoystick.prefab       ← variant: Sort Order 1
├── CanvasOverlay.prefab        ← variant: Sort Order 10
└── CanvasPopup.prefab          ← variant: Sort Order 100
```

**BaseCanvas holds:**
- `Canvas` component — Render Mode: Screen Space - Overlay (default)
- `CanvasScaler` — Scale Mode: Scale With Screen Size, Reference Resolution (e.g. 1080×1920), Match: 0.5
- `GraphicRaycaster`
- Any project-wide safe area or resolution handler script

**Variants override only:**
- `Canvas.sortingOrder` — each canvas has its own layer order
- `Canvas.renderMode` — if a specific canvas needs Camera or World Space
- Children (HUD elements, joystick widgets, popup containers)

**Why:** `CanvasScaler` reference resolution and match settings must be identical across all canvases. A BaseCanvas enforces this — change it once, all variants inherit it. Without a base, one canvas will inevitably drift to a different resolution setting and break layout on certain screen sizes.

## Folder Structure

All prefabs live under `_GameFolders/Prefabs/`, grouped by domain:

```
_GameFolders/
└── Prefabs/
    ├── Enemies/
    │   ├── BaseEnemy.prefab
    │   ├── FastEnemy.prefab
    │   └── TankEnemy.prefab
    ├── UI/
    │   ├── Canvases/      ← full-screen Canvas prefabs (MainMenuCanvas, GameCanvas…)
    │   ├── Popups/        ← popup and dialog prefabs
    │   ├── Panels/        ← panel prefabs
    │   └── Utilities/     ← single reusable elements (Button, Icon, Label…)
    ├── VFX/
    │   └── ExplosionEffect.prefab
    └── Environment/
        └── Platform.prefab
```

- One subfolder per domain — never dump prefabs directly into `Prefabs/`
- Subfolder name matches the domain (Enemies, UI, VFX, Environment, Player, Projectiles…)
- Base prefabs and their variants live in the same subfolder

## Logic vs Visual Separation (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

Every prefab separates logic components from visual components across two levels:

```
Player.prefab                  ← Root: logic components only
├── PlayerProvider.cs
├── PlayerController.cs
└── Body/                      ← Child: visual components only
    ├── MeshRenderer
    ├── Animator
    └── SkinnedMeshRenderer
```

- **Root GameObject** — holds Provider, Controller, Collider, Rigidbody, and any injected MonoBehaviours
- **`Body` child** (or `Visual`, `Mesh` — be consistent per project) — holds Renderer, Animator, particle systems, and any purely visual components
- Logic scripts never sit on the same GameObject as a Renderer
- Visual child has no logic scripts; root has no Renderer components

**Why:** Swapping visuals (skin, LOD, VFX) never touches logic. Animating, hiding, or replacing the visual subtree is isolated — root stays stable.

## Rules Summary

| Rule | Why |
|------|-----|
| Every scene GameObject is a prefab instance | Reusability, Addressables compatibility |
| Shared-base objects use Prefab Variants | Single source of truth, easier iteration |
| Prefabs grouped by domain under `_GameFolders/Prefabs/` | Predictable location, clean Project window |
| Never duplicate a prefab manually | Use Prefab Variants instead |
| Empty hierarchy organizers are the only bare GameObjects allowed | No components = no logic = no maintenance cost |
| Logic components on root, visual components on `Body` child | Decouples visual swaps from logic, clear responsibility |
| `AppScope` / `LifetimeScope` with only ScriptableObject refs → `Prefabs/Bootstrap/` | Asset refs are stored on the prefab; no scene-time drag-and-drop needed |
| `EventSystem` and `MainCamera` → `Prefabs/CoreObjects/`, same prefab in every scene | Consistent settings, single source of truth across all scenes |

## Prefab Duplication from Third-Party Packages (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

Prefabs that ship inside a third-party UPM package (under `Library/PackageCache/<name>@<version>/`) or an Asset Store package (under `Assets/Plugins/<vendor>/`) must NEVER be referenced directly from a scene, a Resources reference, an Addressables entry, or another prefab.

**Why:** Package contents are immutable from the project's perspective — UPM rewrites `Library/PackageCache/` on every resolve, and Asset Store updates overwrite `Assets/Plugins/`. Any in-scene reference to a package GUID breaks with a "missing prefab" error on version bump; any in-package edit is silently lost.

### Procedure

1. Identify the source prefab inside the package directory.
2. Choose a category folder under `_GameFolders/Prefabs/<Category>/` matching the existing domain folders.
3. Duplicate the prefab using **Project window → right-click → Duplicate**. Do NOT copy `.meta` files from the package — Unity will mint a fresh GUID.
4. Replace any in-scene/in-prefab reference to the package GUID with the new GUID from the duplicate.
5. Apply the Logic vs Visual Separation rule to the duplicate.

### Rules

| Rule | Why |
|------|-----|
| Never drag a `Library/PackageCache/...` prefab into a scene | Reference breaks on package upgrade |
| Always duplicate into `_GameFolders/Prefabs/<Category>/` first | Project owns the GUID and the asset lifecycle |
| Never edit a package prefab in place | UPM resolve overwrites it; Asset Store update overwrites it |
| Never copy `.meta` files from the package source | Forces Unity to assign a fresh GUID |
| Place duplicates by category, not by package | Keeps the project-side prefab tree organized by domain, not by vendor |

See also: `/discover` writes the per-package duplication plan into `.codex/packs/unity-game/skills/plugins/<package>/SKILL.md` under the `## Prefabs` section.
