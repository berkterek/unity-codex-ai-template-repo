# /migrate — Migrator → Reviewer → Committer Pipeline

> Apply `.codex/packs/unity-game/guides/guardrails.md` rules throughout.


Migrates legacy code patterns to current standards: migrator converts, reviewer checks, committer commits.

## Usage

```
/migrate <what and where>
/migrate coroutines → UniTask in Assets/_Game/Scripts/Core/
/migrate singleton GameManager to VContainer in Assets/_Game/Scripts/
```

If no argument is given, ask:
1. What pattern needs migrating? (coroutine→UniTask, singleton→VContainer, Debug.Log→wrapper, Input.GetKey→New Input System, other)
2. Which files or folder?

## Step 0 — Plugin Preflight

Check which of these plugins are available in the skill list:

| Plugin | Used in | Fallback |
|--------|---------|---------|
| `superpowers:verification-before-completion` | Completion — verify migration is complete before commit (complexity ≥ 0.7) | Skip verification gate |

Print availability status before proceeding:
```
Plugins: superpowers:verification-before-completion [✓/✗]
```

## Step 0b — Complexity Scoring

**Step 0a — Read Review Mode**

Read `production/review-mode.txt` (default: `lean` if file missing). This controls pipeline depth:

| Mode | Effect |
|------|--------|
| `solo` | Test guard ve unity-developer yok — migrator → committer only. |
| `lean` | Standard pipeline. For regular solo development. |
| `full` | Standard pipeline + unity-developer second reviewer always active (regardless of complexity score). For team review or learning sessions. |

Set mode by editing `production/review-mode.txt`. Print the active mode before proceeding.

Before spawning any agents, score the migration complexity on a 0.0–1.0 scale:

| Score | Label | Signals | Pipeline variant |
|-------|-------|---------|-----------------|
| 0.0–0.3 | **Simple** | Single file, mechanical substitution (e.g. one coroutine) | migrator/unity-migrator → reviewer → committer |
| 0.4–0.6 | **Medium** | Multiple files, interface changes, or VContainer rewiring | test guard → migrator/unity-migrator → reviewer → committer |
| 0.7–1.0 | **Complex** | Cross-module migration, ECS involvement, or Addressables | test guard → migrator/unity-migrator → codex:codex-rescue reviewer → unity-developer → committer |

**Migrator agent routing — decide before spawning:**

| Migration type | Agent |
|----------------|-------|
| Pure C# pattern (no Unity API: data classes, interfaces, services) | **migrator** |
| Unity-specific (coroutine→UniTask, singleton→VContainer, Input.GetKey→New Input System) | **unity-migrator** |

**Scoring signals:**
- Touches more than 5 files? +0.3
- Changes a public interface or adds IEventBus events? +0.2
- Involves ECS systems or Addressables? +0.3
- Single file, single pattern? −0.3

**Print before proceeding:**
```
Complexity: [score] — [Label]
Rationale: [one sentence]
Migrator Agent: [migrator | unity-migrator]
Pipeline: [which variant]
Review Mode: [solo | lean | full]
```

### SCOPE_GATE

Show the user the SCOPE_GATE block from `.codex/packs/unity-game/docs/director-gates.md`.
Pass: migration description, complexity score, known affected files or folder.
Wait for `go` before proceeding.

After receiving `go` → run:
```bash
mkdir -p .codex/state && echo '{"gate":"SCOPE_GATE","pipeline":"migrate","ts":"'$(date -u +%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ)'"}' > .codex/state/gate-cleared
```

If the migration scope touches more than 5 files (scoring signal "+0.3 Touches more than 5 files"): also fire **BREAKING_GATE** (see `.codex/packs/unity-game/docs/director-gates.md`). Show all files in scope and wait for `go` or `stop`.

## Pipeline

```
[1] TEST GUARD → [2] MIGRATOR → [3] REVIEWER ⟲ (loop until APPROVED) → [4] COMMITTER
```

---

## Step 1 — Test Guard

> **Skip this step if complexity score is Simple (0.0–0.3) and review mode is not `full`.**

Spawn Agent with `subagent_type: "claude"` with this prompt:

```
Read .codex/packs/unity-game/agents/tester.md for your role and testing philosophy.
Read .codex/packs/unity-game/rules/testing.md for project-specific rules — these override tester.md where they conflict.
Read .codex/project/PROJECT.md for project architecture.

## Project overrides (take precedence over tester.md)
- Use NSubstitute for mocking, not hand-rolled fakes
- Only mock interfaces, never concrete classes

## Migration Task
$MIGRATION_DESCRIPTION

## Your job
1. Check if tests already exist for the code being migrated.
2. If tests exist and cover the relevant behavior → report: TESTS EXIST, list them.
3. If tests are missing → write them now, covering the behavior that must survive the migration.
4. These tests must pass BEFORE migration starts.

Report: TESTS EXIST or TESTS WRITTEN, with list of test files and what each covers.
Report: DONE or BLOCKED with reason.
```

If BLOCKED → stop and show the user.

---

## Step 2 — Migrator

Spawn Agent with `subagent_type: "unity-migrator"` with this prompt:

```
You are a Unity code migration specialist. Migrate legacy patterns in this project.

## Migration Task
$MIGRATION_DESCRIPTION

## Project Rules
- Read .codex/project/PROJECT.md before making any changes
- Follow all rules in .codex/packs/unity-game/rules/
- Migrate conservatively: same behavior, different implementation
- Do NOT add features or refactor beyond the migration
- Every file you touch must compile and work after your edit
- Check every file that depends on the migrated code

## Common Migration Patterns

### Coroutine → UniTask
- IEnumerator + yield return → async UniTask
- WaitForSeconds → UniTask.Delay
- StartCoroutine → .Forget() or await
- Every async method must have CancellationToken parameter

### Singleton → VContainer
- Remove static Instance
- Register in the appropriate LifetimeScope installer
- Replace all call sites with injected interface

### Legacy Input → New Input System
- Input.GetKey / Input.GetAxis → PlayerControls actions
- All input reading must go through InputView

## When Done
List every file you changed with a one-line summary of what was migrated.
Report: DONE or BLOCKED with reason.
```

If BLOCKED → stop and show the user.

---

## Step 3 — Reviewer

Reviewer priority — try in order, fall back if unavailable:
1. Spawn Agent with `subagent_type: "codex:codex-rescue"`
2. Spawn Agent with `subagent_type: "unity-reviewer"` (fallback if Codex unavailable)

Reviewer prompt:
```
Review this code migration.

## Migration
$MIGRATION_DESCRIPTION

## Files Changed
$MIGRATOR_OUTPUT

## Review Criteria
1. Tests pass — all pre-migration tests still pass after migration; no test files were modified
2. Correctness — same behavior before and after, no regressions
3. Completeness — all instances of the old pattern are migrated, no leftovers
4. Architecture — VContainer DI, no singletons, interfaces only across modules
5. UniTask rules — no async void, CancellationToken on every async method
6. Unity null safety — no ?. or is null on UnityEngine objects

## Output Format
APPROVED or CHANGES NEEDED with file:line issues.
```

### Review Loop

Repeat until APPROVED or stopped (max 3 passes):

1. If reviewer reports **CHANGES NEEDED** → spawn a **migrator** subagent to fix every listed issue:
   ```
   You are a Unity code migration specialist. Fix the following review issues.

   ## Original Migration
   $MIGRATION_DESCRIPTION

   ## Review Feedback (fix ALL of these)
   $REVIEWER_FEEDBACK

   ## Rules
   - Fix only what the reviewer flagged — do not refactor anything else
   - Read .codex/project/PROJECT.md before making changes

   ## When Done
   List every file you changed with a one-line summary.
   Report: DONE or BLOCKED with reason.
   ```

2. After migrator fixes → re-run the reviewer using the same priority order (codex:codex-rescue → unity-reviewer) with the updated files.

3. If APPROVED → proceed to Step 3.

4. If still **CHANGES NEEDED** after 3 passes → stop and show the user all remaining issues. Ask:
   - `skip` → proceed to commit (user accepts responsibility)
   - `stop` → abort, leave files uncommitted

### unity-developer Pass (Complex only)

If complexity score ≥ 0.7 and review mode is `lean` or `full`: after reviewer reports APPROVED, spawn a **unity-developer** subagent with this prompt:

```
Review this migration for Unity-specific correctness.

## Migration Task
$MIGRATION_DESCRIPTION

## Files Changed
$MIGRATOR_OUTPUT

## Review Criteria (from .codex/packs/unity-game/agents/unity-developer.md)
- Hot-path allocations introduced?
- Draw call regressions?
- ECS safety (structural changes via ECB only)?
- Addressables handle lifecycle correct?
- Prefab structure intact (root=logic / Body=visual)?
- UniTask cancellation tokens present on all async methods?

## Output Format
APPROVED — migration is correct.

CHANGES NEEDED:
- [file:line] Issue and fix.
```

If CHANGES NEEDED → spawn **unity-migrator** to fix, then re-run unity-developer (max 2 passes).

---

### COMMIT_GATE

Show the user the COMMIT_GATE block from `.codex/packs/unity-game/docs/director-gates.md`.
Pass: migration description, all changed files, reviewer verdict.
Wait for `go` before spawning the committer. `stop` → leave files staged, print summary without committing.

---

## Step 4 — Committer

**Execute commits directly.** Read `.codex/packs/unity-game/agents/committer.md` for full conventions, then:

- Migration: `$MIGRATION_DESCRIPTION`
- Files changed: `$MIGRATOR_OUTPUT`
- Run: `git status`, `git diff`
- Stage only migration-related files
- Commit message format: `"refactor: migrate <pattern> in <scope>"`
- One commit per migration type (if multiple patterns, split commits)
- Do NOT push; report: commit hash(es) and message(s)

---

## Completion

Run: `rm -f .codex/state/gate-cleared`

**If `superpowers:verification-before-completion` is available AND complexity score ≥ 0.7:** Invoke it before reporting done. Verify every old pattern instance was replaced and no orphaned references remain.

Print:
```
## ✓ Migration Complete
Migration: [description]
Files changed: [count]
Commit: [hash] — [message]
Reviewer: [Codex | Claude] — APPROVED
```
