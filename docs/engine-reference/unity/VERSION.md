## How to Use This File

Before any architectural decision touching Unity APIs:
1. Check the risk level for the area
2. If Medium or High: read `breaking-changes.md` and `current-best-practices.md`
3. Apply gate `TD-UNITY-RISK` from `.codex/packs/unity-game/guides/director-gates.md`
4. Stamp TDD decisions with: `> Engine: Unity 6 LTS — risk assessed via TD-UNITY-RISK`
